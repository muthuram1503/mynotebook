Mother – My Guiding Light
A gentle touch, a soothing smile,
You’ve walked with me through every mile.
In your embrace, all fears subside,
With you, my joy and hope reside.

Through sleepless nights, you stayed so near,
To wipe away each trembling tear.
With every fall, you helped me rise,
Your love shines bright, like endless skies.

You taught me dreams, you taught me care,
To face the world, to always dare.
No treasure matches your warm grace,
Your love, no time could e'er replace.

So here’s my song, so true, so deep—
For you, dear Mom, my heart shall keep.
Forever grateful, forever near,
You are my sunshine, always dear.
